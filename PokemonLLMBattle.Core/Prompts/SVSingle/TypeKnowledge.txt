KEEP THESE TYPE PROPERTIES IN MIND WHEN EVALUATING MOVES AND EFFECTS.
**Terastalization Key Points**  
- **Type Effectiveness:** Move effectiveness is recalculated based on the Tera Type after Terastalizing. Original typing no longer affects super-effective or not-very-effective damage.  
- **STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus):**    
  - Matching Tera Type ⇒ +1.5× power (stacks with original STAB).    
  - If Tera Type is the same as one of the Pokémon’s original types ⇒ total STAB can become ×2.    
- **Tera Type: Star Variant:**    
  - STAB becomes ×2 if matching the Tera Type, ×1.2 even if not matching.    
  - The extra power applies only on the first use of a move with that attribute unless the Pokémon is *Terapagos* or it is a Tera Raid Battle (then there is no usage limit).    
- **Single-Type Calculation:** When an effect (move, ability, item) depends on the Pokémon’s type, only the Tera Type is considered. The original type’s special effects are lost; the Tera Type’s effects are gained.  
- **Status/Conditions Interaction:**    
  - Pre-existing status conditions (e.g., *Leech Seed* on Tera Grass) are not removed upon Terastalizing.    
  - If a Pokémon was trapped before Terastalizing into a Ghost Tera Type, it cannot remove the trap status automatically but can still be switched out.    
- **Type-Changing Moves/Abilities:** Moves or abilities that add/change typing (*Soak*, *Protean*, *Libero*, etc.) do not overwrite the Tera Type. Post-Terastal, the Pokémon’s type stays as Tera Type plus any original type details are inactive.  
- **Tera Blast & Revelation Dance:** These moves always become the Pokémon’s Tera Type, ignoring other type-modifying effects (e.g., *Pixilate*).

If a field condition like Tailwind is already active, using the same move again will fail rather than extending its remaining turns.
